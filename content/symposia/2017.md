Following the success of last years Cytomining Hackathon, where data scientists from 20 of the worlds top high-content screening laboratories came together to set a path for the field, the hackathon is back. Running over 3 days and 3 nights, we’ll begin with a day of talks, networking, and discussion before getting down to the hacking itself. For the Hackathon we’ll prepare a previously unseen imaging dataset. Working in groups, your task will be to develop novel software and analysis techniques to extract information from the dataset. Following this, your group will pitch the project to a panel of judges where prizes will be awarded, and hopefully new collaborations and ideas formed.
