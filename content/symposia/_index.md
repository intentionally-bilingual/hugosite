CytoDS will grant the use of its name and its full support to the organization of an annual scientific meeting of the image-based profiling research community. The purpose of these meetings is discussing recent advances in the field and fostering communication within the research community. Connections with other domains are forge by inviting experts from those fields to give a presentation at the symposium. The agenda is created by the organizers, while CytoDS will assist in fundraising, outreach and general organizational questions. The location of the meeting should be chosen based on an online poll sent to all members of the society, and must adhere to the equal rights policies of the society.
