The field of image-based profiling is still in its infancy, and its adoption has been slow, primarily due to the data analysis challenges posed, the large imaging experiments required, and the lack of ground-truth data sets where relationships among images are known. The CytoData Society aims to bring image-based profiling into the mainstream by organizing a striving community working on this technology.

The CytoData society (CytoDS) builds and maintains an active community around image-based profiling of biological phenotypes induced by genetic, chemical or other perturbations of biological systems.

*CytoData Society is an unregistered society, meaning that the society does not have an official status in any country. Instead, we are an active community of researchers and developers. We consider everyone in our mailing list as a member of the society.*
