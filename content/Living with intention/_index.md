On this page you can find information and most of all experiences of our us living with intention. The page is devided into three categories for now. They are (Montessori) parenting, sustainability, and more. As the pages grow in number, I'll probably subdivide "more" into specific subcategories. Feel free to roam about and learn more about our take on intentional living.  

Keep in mind that unlike the page about bilingualism, these posts are less built on professional experience and research, and more on personal experiences and beliefs. Feel free to disagree and I'd love to discuss and be pointed to new ideas that might suit us. Wherever possible though, I try to include facts and research-based information.
