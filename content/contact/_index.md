Feel free to contact me for any reason. Did you read something you don't quite understand or want to discuss? Do you have tips or other questions about the site or my work in general? Do you want to know more about something I didn't write about yet? Let me know by sending an email or contacting me via social media.

If you have specific questions about your own situation, I can of course help you out with customed tips and ideas.  
For a more indepth counseling, please contact me and we'll discuss the possibilities. Examples of this are workshops and presentations at work or with a small group, or creating a fully personalised family language policy with specific tips and coaching on your particular family or situation.
